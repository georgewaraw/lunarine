## Lunarine
is a tiny WebGL demo made using [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [Tween.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js).
It works on desktop and mobile with PWA support for iOS.
The gameplay concept is a merging of an endless runner with a rhythm game:
the player moves left or right to enter or exit the areas of the screen that are distorted by the music.
While in these areas, the player accumulates points but also receives damage.
The area to be distorted is indicated by the floating shape's movements.

#### Controls:
On desktop, move left or right with A, D, or arrow keys. On mobile, swipe left or right.
