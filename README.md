## Lunarine
is a small WebGL game demo made using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [es6-tween](https://github.com/tweenjs/es6-tween) libraries.
It works on desktop and mobile with PWA support for both iOS and Android.
The gameplay is a merging of an endless runner with a rhythm game:
the player moves left or right to enter or exit the areas of the screen that are distorted by the music.
While in these areas, the player accumulates points but also receives damage.
The goal is to gain as many points as possible without dying.
To do so, it is important to move outside the distorted areas before receiving too much damage, moving back inside upon recovery.
