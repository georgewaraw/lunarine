## LUNARINE
is a small [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) game demo.
It works on desktop and mobile with PWA support for iOS and Android.
The gameplay is an endless runner plus a rhythm game:
the player moves left or right to enter/exit areas of screen that are distorted by the music.
In these areas, player receives both points and damage.
Outside them, the player regenerates.
The goal is to gain as many points as possible without dying.
